    "# Part 2: A Simple Agent Based Model In Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "In this second tutorial, we will build our first simple network of agents using the commands in the first notebook.\n",
    "We will create a network of multiple simple agents who interact in random dyads, and simulate changes in the community over multiple interactions. \n",
    "In each interaction, one agent (the producer) produces one of two possible vowel variants according to their existing representations. Then, the second agent (the listener) can either stick to their existing variant, or adapt to the producer by changing their vowel accordingly. The listener's behavior is based on biased \"personalities\": agents can be flexible (adapt to their partner) or stubborn (not adapt).\n",
    "We repeat this process multiple times and see what happens to the variants in the population at large. We will try to answer questions like: Has one of the variants spread to the entire community? Does this depend on the community's size and inital structure? How many stubborn people must be present to prevent (or faciliate?) convergence? etc.\n",
